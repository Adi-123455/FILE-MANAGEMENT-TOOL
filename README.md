DESCRIPTION:
This C++ file management tool is a console-based application that demonstrates essential file-handling techniques using the C++ Standard Library. It is developed using C++17 and built with any standard compiler such as g++ or an IDE like Code::Blocks or Visual Studio. The program uses the <iostream>, <fstream>, <string>, and <cstdio> libraries to perform various file operations, including creating files, writing data, reading from files, appending new content, overwriting existing content, checking if a file exists, and deleting files. File streams such as ofstream, ifstream, and fstream form the backbone of this application. It begins by allowing the user to create and write to a file. This is accomplished using ofstream file("example.txt");, where the ofstream object opens a file in write mode, creating the file if it doesn’t exist and truncating it if it does. The program writes lines like "Hello, this is a file creation example in C++.\n" using file << stream insertion. Once the writing is complete, the file is closed using file.close(). Reading from the file is done with an ifstream object using ifstream file("example.txt"); and a loop that calls getline(file, line) to read and display each line to the console. To demonstrate appending, the program uses ofstream file("example.txt", ios::app); which opens the file in append mode and writes new data without erasing the existing content. This operation is verified by reading the file again. The program also includes a feature to overwrite the entire file content using the same ofstream constructor without the append flag, effectively replacing the previous content with new lines such as "This file content has been overwritten.\n". To check whether a file exists before performing operations, a utility function attempts to open the file using ifstream and returns true if file.is_open() evaluates to true, thus confirming its existence. Deleting a file is handled through the remove() function provided in <cstdio>, where remove("example.txt") attempts to delete the file and returns 0 upon success, or a non-zero value if deletion fails. Each of these functions—create, read, append, overwrite, check existence, and delete—are encapsulated in separate helper functions for clarity and modular design. The main() function calls these operations sequentially to simulate real-world file processing, starting with file creation, reading, appending, updating, and finally deletion. Throughout the program, proper error handling is included using condition checks like if (file.is_open()) and fallback error messages to inform the user when a file operation fails. This ensures the program behaves predictably even when faced with inaccessible or non-existent files. The use of stream flags such as ios::in, ios::out, ios::app, and their combinations demonstrates the flexibility of file I/O in C++. Overall, this C++ file management tool offers a hands-on and complete demonstration of how file operations can be implemented efficiently, making it suitable for both educational and real-world applications where file access and manipulation are required.
